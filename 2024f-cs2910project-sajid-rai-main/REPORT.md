# Reflection
_A reflection on your experiences with generative AI during this project. Provide a few sentences reflecting
on your experience with AI for each of the following prompts._ 

### What generative AI did you use, and what tasks did you use it for?
_**Example:** Git Co-Pilot: generated getters and setters_

### How did you learn about the tools used by your group (delete ones that don't apply)?
_Please describe where and how you learned about the tools_

### Reflecting on your experience:
_Write a short reflection on your use of generative AI in this project, including if you did not use it. 
You may use the prompts as headings if you wish. (500 words)_  

**Prompts to think about in writing your reflections if you worked with generative AI:**
- What went well using generative AI in this project?
- What went well using generative AI?
- What didnâ€™t go well using generative AI?
- Were there any limitations you encountered using generative AI?
- How did your solution change/evolve/improve/degrade because of the generative AI?
- What could you have done so the project turned out better?

**Prompts to think about in writing your reflections if you didn't use generative AI:**
- Why did you choose not to use generative AI in this project?
- Were there particular problems that you encountered where you think generative AI would have helped?
- Were there particular things you were glad you learned to do yourself without the use of generative AI?
- What could you have done so the project would turn out better?
